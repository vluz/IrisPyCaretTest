# IrisPyCaretTest
### PyCaret example using the Iris dataset

PyCaret is a powerful Python library for machine learning that automates the process of preparing data and comparing different models. 
<br>
Here's an example using PyCaret to classify the famous Iris dataset.


This example loads the Iris dataset, sets up the PyCaret environment, compares different classification models, 
<br>
selects the best model (Random Forest in this case), tunes its hyperparameters, evaluates the model, 
<br>
makes predictions, finalizes the model, and saves it to a file.

(optional) You can create a virtual environment with:
```
python -m venv "venv"
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install do:
```
git clone https://github.com/vluz/IrisPyCaretTest.git
cd IrisPyCaretTest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run do:<br>
`python IrisPyCaretExample.py` for the cli version
<br>or
open the notebook named `IrisPyCaretNotebook.ipynb`
